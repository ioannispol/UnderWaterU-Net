Welcome to UnderWaterU-Net, a deep learning repository specially optimized for underwater image segmentation. With challenges like inconsistent lighting, suspended particles, and the dynamic nature of the underwater environment, traditional image segmentation models often fall short. Enter UnderWaterU-Net: a tailored solution designed with the depths in mind.

## 🌟 Features

- **Tailored U-Net Architecture**: Customized to perform optimally on underwater images.
- **Expandable with Submodules**: Modular design allows for easy expansion and incorporation of additional functionalities.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: From raw underwater images to precise segmentations, UnderWaterU-Net makes the process seamless.
